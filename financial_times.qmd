# Executive vs. Employee Adoption

- CEOs have bought Ferraris (AI systems) but haven’t given staff driving lessons. 
- Survey of 10,000 desk workers:

  - Top concerns: data security, privacy, accuracy, reliability.
- Executive urgency has increased 7× in the last 6 months.

# AI Personas (Slack Research)

1. **Maximalist:** Enthusiastic, active users.
2. **Underground:** Active users hiding usage (fear of being seen as cheating).
3. **Rebel:** Avoids AI, sees it as a threat.
4. **Superfan:** Excited but unsure how to start.
5. **Observer:** Wait-and-see, cautious interest.
