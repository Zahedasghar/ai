# Part 10: Advanced Prompt Techniques

## Chain Prompting for Complex Tasks

### Research Paper Development

```markdown
**Stage 1: Topic Exploration**
"I'm economist researching AI labor market impacts. Brainstorm 
20 channels through which AI affects employment. One line each."

**Stage 2: Focus Selection**
"From these 20 channels, identify 5 most suitable for academic paper. 
For each, explain: novelty, data availability, policy relevance."

**Stage 3: Literature Positioning**
"For channel #2 (cognitive automation), what are 5 key existing 
papers and how would my focus differ?"

**Stage 4: Research Design**
"Design research plan for this paper including:
- Research questions
- Methodology options
- Data requirements
- Expected contributions"

**Stage 5: Outline Development**
"Create detailed outline for 8000-word paper on this topic."
```

## Iterative Refinement

### Draft Improvement Cycle

```markdown
**Round 1: Initial Draft**
[Provide draft section]

**Round 2: Structural Feedback**
"Analyze structure of this section. Suggest reorganization for 
better flow and logical progression."

**Round 3: Content Enhancement**
"Identify gaps in argumentation. What evidence or examples 
would strengthen key claims?"

**Round 4: Style Refinement**
"Improve academic tone and clarity. Eliminate jargon where simpler 
language works. Vary sentence structure."

**Round 5: Final Polish**
"Proofread for grammar, consistency in terminology, citation format, 
and overall coherence."
```

# Part 11: Troubleshooting & Optimization

## Common Prompt Problems & Solutions

### Issue 1: Vague Responses

❌ **Problem Prompt:**
"Tell me about economic growth."

✅ **Solution:**
```markdown
<role>Development economist</role>
<task>Explain economic growth drivers in developing countries</task>
<context>Focus on Pakistan, South Asia region</context>
<specifics>
- Capital accumulation
- Human capital development
- Institutional quality
- Trade integration
- Technological adoption
</specifics>
<output_format>
For each driver:
- Theoretical basis (2-3 sentences)
- Pakistan-specific challenges
- Policy recommendations
- Regional comparisons
</output_format>
```

### Issue 2: Too Much/Too Little Detail

❌ **Problem:**
Output is too brief or too verbose

✅ **Solution:**
Explicitly specify length and depth:

```markdown
"Explain Solow Growth Model:
- Target audience: Undergraduate economics students
- Length: 150-200 words
- Include: Key assumptions, main equations, policy implications
- Exclude: Mathematical derivations, advanced extensions"
```

### Issue 3: Inconsistent Quality

❌ **Problem:**
Results vary significantly across attempts

✅ **Solution:**
Use structured templates with examples:

```markdown
"Generate economic policy brief following this structure:

**Example Structure:**
1. Executive Summary (50 words)
2. Problem Statement (100 words)
3. Policy Options (3 options, 75 words each)
4. Recommendation (50 words)
5. Implementation Roadmap (100 words)

**My Topic:** [Your topic]
**Context:** [Your context]
```
