## Best Practices for Success

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### DO:
::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
- **Be conversational** - Treat Claude like a knowledgeable colleague
- **Provide examples** - Show what good output looks like  
- **Ask for specific formats** - "Create a bulleted list" or "Write in executive summary style"

:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### DON'T:
::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
- **Assume Claude knows your specific context** - Provide background info
- **Accept first draft as final** - Iterate and refine
- **Forget to fact-check** - Especially for critical information  
- **Use for harmful or unethical purposes** - Claude will decline
:::
:::

:::

## Understanding Limitations

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Knowledge Cutoff

- Always verify time-sensitive information

### Not a Search Engine
- Claude reasons and analyzes rather than just retrieving information
- Best for understanding and synthesis, not just facts
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Cannot:
- Access your personal accounts (unless you provide access via tools)
- Remember conversations across different chat sessions
- Learn or update from your conversations
