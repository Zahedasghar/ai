## Six Ethical Rules for Using AI in Research Writing

1. **Use AI as an editor**, not as an author – improve flow and language.
2. **Do not use AI to generate full text** – equivalent to outsourcing authorship.
3. **Use AI for brainstorming** – treat AI as a smart colleague.
4. **Always verify AI outputs** – cross-check with your domain knowledge.
5. **Draw your own conclusions** – not AI's job to finalize interpretations.
6. **Create your own visuals and figures** – AI-generated images not accepted.

## AI for Generating Research Topics

* **Tool: Scispace**

  * Finds trending research topics.
  * Suggests summaries, sources, and references.
* **Tool: AvidNote**

  * Generates research questions based on your detailed input.

> 🔍 Start with AI suggestions, then validate with literature.

##  Finding Research Gaps Faster

* **Scispace + Consensus** tools:

  * Upload multiple PDFs to identify gaps, limitations, and future work.
  * Use consensus to detect conflicting studies.
  * Generate at-a-glance tables on research limitations.

> ⚡ Saves hours of manual reading.

1. **Generate keywords** for literature reviews.
2. **Read faster** using chat with document features.
3. **Build theoretical frameworks** using AI suggestions.
4. **Pick the right methodology** with multiple suggestions.
5. **Design research tools**: Interview and survey questions.
6. **Analyze data** qualitatively and quantitatively.
7. **Structure your paper** using AI templates.
8. **Brainstorm while writing**: Ask for ideas, definitions, flow.
9. **Proofread/edit** text at low cost (e.g., Paperpal).
10. **Find the right journal** based on your abstract.
11. **Prepare final docs**: Title, abstract, keywords, cover letter.
12. **Run AI detection + plagiarism scan**.
13. **Promote your paper** with threads and videos.
14. **Generate new research ideas** using your reference list.

> 🎯 Use AI as a productivity enhancer, not as a shortcut.
