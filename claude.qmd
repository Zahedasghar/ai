Make it educational and engaging for undergraduate students.
```

### Prompt 7: Teaching Material Generation

```markdown
Create an interactive infographic that summarizes [economic concept/theory] 
for my undergraduate economics course. The visualization should:
1. Show relationships between key variables
2. Include real-world examples
3. Use clear, student-friendly language
4. Incorporate current economic data where relevant
5. Be suitable for both digital and print formats
```

## Part 6: Advanced Analysis Workflows

### Prompt 8: Econometric Analysis Setup

```markdown
I have economic time series data with the following variables: [list variables].

## Best Practices for Economics Research

### Effective Prompting Strategies

1. **Be Specific About Context**: Always specify your field (labor economics, macroeconomics, etc.)
2. **Include Data Descriptions**: Provide variable definitions and data sources
3. **Request Multiple Approaches**: Ask for alternative methodologies
4. **Emphasize Interpretation**: Always ask for economic meaning, not just statistical results
5. **Consider Policy Relevance**: Frame findings in terms of practical applications

### Quality Control Tips

1. **Verify Statistical Results**: Always double-check Claude's calculations
2. **Cross-Reference Literature**: Confirm theoretical frameworks and citations
3. **Test Code Outputs**: Run generated R/Python code to ensure functionality
4. **Peer Review**: Use Claude to review your own work from different perspectives

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When Claude Makes Errors
- Ask Claude to "debug and fix the error in your previous analysis"
- Provide specific error messages or unexpected results
- Request step-by-step explanations of methodology

### Improving Output Quality
- Use follow-up prompts to refine results
- Ask for specific formatting (APA, Chicago, etc.)
- Request alternative approaches when initial results are unsatisfactory

## Workshop Exercise

**Practical Application:**
Upload your own economic dataset and work through this workflow:

1. Use Prompt 1 for initial exploration
2. Apply Prompt 2 or 8 for detailed analysis
3. Create visualizations using Prompt 3
4. Generate a brief report using elements from Prompt 10

## Additional Resources

- **Claude Projects**: Organize related research streams
- **Artifacts Feature**: Download and modify generated content
- **Analysis Tool**: Direct data processing and visualization
- **Google Drive Integration**: Seamless document workflow

## Conclusion

Claude excels at three key areas for economics research:
1. **Complex Data Analysis**: From messy datasets to publication-ready visualizations
2. **Interactive Content Creation**: Dashboards and educational materials
3. **Research Communication**: From technical analysis to accessible explanations

The key to success is combining Claude's capabilities with your economic expertise and always maintaining critical evaluation of results.
