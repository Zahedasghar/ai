# 2. Economics & Policy Analysis Prompts

## 2.1 Pakistani Budget Analysis Framework

### Comprehensive Budget Analysis
```
Analyze Pakistan's Federal Budget 2025-26 focusing on:
1. Overall fiscal posture and deficit financing
2. Revenue vs expenditure dynamics (Rs18.9 trillion FY25 allocations)
3. Sectoral allocation priorities
4. Long-term sustainability implications

Break down the planned deficit financing into domestic vs. external borrowing. What risks and costs are associated with each component?

Calculate the projected tax-to-GDP ratio. How does it compare to the 5-year average and regional peers?

What share of total expenditure is allocated to interest payments (Rs9.775 trillion)? How might this crowd out development spending compared to Rs1.4 trillion PSDP allocation?
```

### Growth-Oriented Budget Reallocation
```
Design a reallocation framework of Pakistan's 2025 PSDP outlay (worth Rs. 2,500 billion) to carve out Rs. 500–600 billion for defense, without disproportionately affecting health and education. Justify your decisions with developmental multipliers and geopolitical threats.

Evaluate the impact of diverting 1% of GDP from non-development into an export-credit agency and FX-hedging facility for SMEs. Quantify net FX inflows, debt sustainability, and security risks.
```

## 2.2 IMF Program Analysis

### Program Impact Assessment
```
Compare Pakistan's recent federal budget with IMF program conditionalities. Identify points of alignment and conflict, especially in subsidy rationalization and SOE reform.

Analyze the impact of IMF programs on Pakistan's economic growth from 2000-2024:
1. Short-term stabilization effects
2. Long-term growth implications
3. Social and distributional impacts
4. Alternative policy approaches
Support with data and evidence.
```

- Growth-friendly adjustment paths
- Risk mitigation strategies
Include sensitivity analysis for key variables.
```

## 2.3 Growth-First Policy Prompts

### Macro-Fiscal Framework Design
```
Draft a five-year macro-fiscal framework that lifts real GDP growth to 6%+ while keeping inflation below 8%. 

Context: Pakistan's historical IMF programmes have averaged 3% growth and double-digit inflation.

Reference: Use Kenya's 2010-15 expansion and Egypt's 2016 post-devaluation rebound as comparators.

Evaluate: Show the fiscal-monetary mix, yearly debt ratio path, and employment gains.

Iterate: Stress-test against oil-price and rupee-shock scenarios.
```

### Export Engine Analysis
```
Map the three highest-potential export engines (e.g., IT services, value-added textiles, agritech). Quantify how removing IMF-imposed energy-tariff caps and import compression would raise each sector's output and FX earnings over five years. Flag required enabling reforms and crowd-in investment.

- Include author names, paper titles, and publication year when citing
- Use formal academic English — avoid casual tone
- Default citation format is APA unless user specifies otherwise
- Always structure your output with clear section headings: Abstract, Summary by Source, Comparative Analysis, and Synthesis & Takeaways
- End with a full bibliography
- Assume all inputs are from reputable academic sources unless told otherwise

When a user gives you a document, treat it like a scholarly text. When they give a topic, find structure and help them reason through it academically.

You are not a chatbot. You are a rigorous academic co-author.
```

### Structured Research Analysis Template
```
You are now an academic research assistant trained in synthesizing scholarly literature across disciplines.

• Build data-backed forecasts using assumptions (state them)
• Identify top vendors and categorize them by niche, scale, or innovation
• Highlight risks, emerging players, and future trends

Be analytical, not vague. Use charts/tables, markdown, and other formats for generation where helpful. Be explicit about what's estimated vs known.

Use this structure:
1. Market Overview
2. Key Players
3. Forecast (1–3 years)
4. Opportunities & Risks
5. Strategic Insights
```

# 9. Quality Assurance & Best Practices

## 9.1 Prompt Improvement Checklist

Before using any prompt, verify:

- [ ] **Clarity**: Is the instruction unambiguous?
- [ ] **Context**: Is sufficient background provided?
- [ ] **Specificity**: Are desired outcomes clearly defined?
- [ ] **Format**: Is the expected output format specified?
- [ ] **Examples**: Are helpful examples included when needed?
- [ ] **Constraints**: Are important limitations mentioned?
- [ ] **Iteration**: Is there room for refinement?

## 9.2 Common Prompt Enhancement Techniques

### For Better Responses:
1. **Add Role Context**: "You are an expert in [field]..."
2. **Specify Format**: "Provide your response in bullet points/table/essay format..."
3. **Include Examples**: "For example..." or "Similar to..."
4. **Set Constraints**: "Keep response under 500 words" or "Focus only on..."
5. **Request Reasoning**: "Explain your reasoning" or "Show your work"

### For Complex Tasks:
1. **Break into Steps**: Use numbered sequences
2. **Chain Prompts**: Build on previous responses
3. **Specify Iteration**: "First draft this, then refine based on..."
4. **Include Review Points**: "After each section, ask for feedback"
