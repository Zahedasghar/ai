<!-- CATS and DOGS Methods Tip Sheet -->
<!-- CATS Method -->
<!-- Context:  Provide detailed background information to guide AI in generating tailored content. -->

<!-- The foundation of your prompt, providing the AI with detailed information about what you need. It involves outlining the specifics, like the purpose of your message, the details of a project, or the nuances of a scenario, ensuring the AI aligns with your intended outcome. -->


<!-- Audience: Understand the audience's characteristics to direct AI's tone, language, and content style. -->

<!-- Essential for tailoring the output to the preferences and expectations of your intended audience.

<!-- Encourages a broad and inclusive approach to prompt engineering, considering various factors and possibilities. This means thinking expansively about what you want the AI to generate, including potential nuances, angles, and aspects that might enrich the output. -->


<!-- Go Back: Iterate on the prompts based on AI's output to refine and achieve the targeted result. -->

<!-- Highlights the iterative nature of working with AI, suggesting a continuous refinement process. This involves revisiting and fine-tuning the prompts based on the AIâ€™s output to better align with your objectives, ensuring the final product meets your expectations. -->


<!-- Style your Product: Personalize the AI-generated content, infusing it with unique touches that reflect personal style or nuances. -->

<!-- Focuses on personalizing the AI-generated output, infusing it with your unique touch. This could involve adding specific anecdotes, adjusting the tone, or embedding particular phrases that reflect your personal style or the intended impact of the content. -->


<!--  and ask it to help you with a definition of both types of AI.   -->
<!-- 2) Then type into the chatbox: â€œHow are predictive AI and generative AI different?"  -->
<!-- 3) Based on the response you get from ChatGPT (which is called output),  -->
<!--           a) list three ways predictive AI and generative AI are different  -->
<!--           b) list three examples predictive AI and three examples of generative AI.   -->
<!-- 4) Type or copy/paste your answer into the space provided here. -->


## Assignment
