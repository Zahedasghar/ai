    "text": "LLMs in Economics\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) that automate a plethora of cognitive tasks presents a significant paradigm shift that academic economists should be cognizant of, given the cognitive nature of our work, which includes tasks such as data analysis, economic forecasting, and policy recommendation. The rapid advancements in language models could potentially disrupt our profession, necessitating a proactive approach to this emerging technology.\nIn the short term, these models can augment our productivity by automating routine tasks, thereby allowing us to focus on more complex and nuanced aspects of economic research. However, in the long run, there is a substantial likelihood that these models could displace human economists, as they become increasingly adept at performing complex cognitive tasks. Consequently, it is incumbent upon us to prepare for this eventuality. This could involve developing a deeper understanding of these models to leverage their capabilities effectively, diversifying our skill sets to include areas not easily automated, and advocating for policies that ensure a just transition for those potentially displaced by these technological advancements."

    "text": "💡 Prompt EngineeringData Analysis Prompts Code\n\n\n\n\nData is significantly transforming our modern world. In today’s digital era, it has become the cornerstone of economic development and drives innovation across all sectors. Data is now the new competitive advantage and even considered a new currency.\nThroughout history, nations gained power based on different strengths like cultural influence, military might, and technological advancements. For example, Ancient India was known for its deep knowledge and rich culture, serving as a center of learning and philosophy. The Roman Empire expanded with organized armies and inventions like the catapult. The Mongol Empire used mobility and trade networks, while the Ottoman Empire relied on heavy artillery and cannons. The British Empire grew through colonization, backed by naval strength and gunpowder. In the 20th century, the United States became a global leader with economic power and military strength.\nNow, in the 21st century, data has become the new source of competitive advantage. It is changing the global landscape and redefining power dynamics. Yet, Pakistan stands at a crossroads, overwhelmed by data but struggling to harness its true potential.\nData fuels economic growth and innovation. The 4th Industrial Revolution uses data, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced analytics to transform industries. It creates opportunities that were unimaginable a few decades ago.\nThere’s a saying,\n\n“Water, water everywhere, nor a drop to drink,” from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.”\n\nIt describes a sailor surrounded by water but unable to drink—a paradox of abundance without usability. We face a similar “Data Paradox” today. We have plenty of data, but not the right kind to make informed decisions. Despite an enormous amount of information, the public sector lacks proper indicators for evidence-based policymaking. Similarly, Generative AI is based on right kind of data.\n\nAnother paradox is the data deluge versus capacity drought.\n\nWhile enormous quantities of data are generated, many organizations and government bodies lack the capability to manage and utilize it effectively. This results in missed opportunities for growth and development. Additionally, data quality remains a significant concern. Reliable, accurate data is essential for sound decision-making. Poor data quality leads to flawed conclusions, wasted resources, and ineffective policies. In Pakistan, inadequate data quality standards hinder our progress, emphasizing the need for robust governance and standardized data practices.\nEvery time we use our mobile phones, swipe our credit cards, or visit a government office, we generate data. In Pakistan alone, millions of these digital records are created daily. This is not just an abstract problem; it affects our privacy and the cost of essential services we depend on.\nData privacy is equally critical. People are increasingly worried about how their personal information is collected and used. To build trust, governments must ensure that data is handled securely. Transparency in data practices can encourage cooperation among citizens, businesses, and government agencies. For example, reports suggest that the data of many Pakistani citizens was hacked or sold on the dark web. Also, many people receive unwanted promotional calls without knowing how the caller got their information. These incidents show weak security measures and reduce public confidence in data systems.\nData quality is another major concern. Good decisions rely on accurate and reliable data. Poor data quality can lead to wrong conclusions, wasted resources, and ineffective policies. In Pakistan, data quality problems hinder progress. We need to set standards and governance rules to build a strong data ecosystem. Local, specific data is crucial for creating policies that address our unique challenges.\nTo tackle these challenges, we need a three-tiered approach that directly addresses the critical failures in our current system.\nFirst, we must treat data infrastructure as essential as roads and power plants. Just as we wouldn’t build a city without proper sewage systems, we can’t develop a modern economy without robust data management systems. This means investing in secure digital infrastructure that can protect citizen data while making it useful for the public good. The success of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) shows us this is possible—we now need to extend that success across all sectors.\nSecond, we need a revolution in data literacy. From government officials to business leaders, teachers to healthcare workers, everyone handling data needs training in its proper use. Universities must integrate data science into their curricula, not just as a specialized field but as a fundamental skill like writing or mathematics.\nThird, we need to have a national data policy as soon as possible. When we share our information with a government agency or private company, we should know exactly how it will be used. The recent Personal Data Protection Bill is a start, but we need stronger enforcement mechanisms and clearer guidelines for both the public and private sectors.\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher. As the world enters the fourth industrial revolution, countries that can effectively harness their data will prosper, while others will fall behind. Pakistan stands at a crossroads—we can either continue drowning in unusable data or build the infrastructure, skills, and governance frameworks needed to turn this digital deluge into a fountain of progress.\nThe choice is ours. Will we let our data wealth slip through our fingers like water, or will we finally build the systems needed to transform it into insight? The future of our digital economy, personal privacy, and national development hangs on this decision.\n\nIt’s time to move from being data-rich but insight-poor to becoming a truly data-intelligent nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "1. Sentiment Analysis of Economic Reports\n\nPrompt: “Analyze the sentiment of the central bank’s monetary policy statement to gauge the tone (hawkish or dovish) and its potential impact on interest rates.”\nApplication: Use sentiment analysis to extract whether a central bank is leaning towards raising or lowering interest rates based on the language used in their statements.\nNLP Task: Sentiment analysis.\nExample Tool: transformers for sentiment analysis.\n\n\n\n2. Entity Recognition in Financial Documents\n\nPrompt: “Identify key economic entities (e.g., countries, companies, sectors) mentioned in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook and their associated actions or trends.”\nApplication: Automatically extract mentions of entities like “United States”, “China”, or “Eurozone” from large economic documents and connect them with economic metrics like GDP growth, inflation, or trade policies.\nNLP Task: Named Entity Recognition (NER).\nExample Tool: spaCy.\n\n\n\n3. Topic Modeling of Economic News\n\nPrompt: “Discover the main topics discussed in a large corpus of macroeconomic news articles published during a financial crisis.”\nApplication: Topic modeling helps in identifying the primary concerns (e.g., inflation, unemployment, fiscal policy) during specific macroeconomic events such as recessions or policy shifts.\nNLP Task: Topic Modeling (LDA, NMF).\nExample Tool: Gensim for topic modeling.\n\n\n\n4. Text Summarization of Economic Reports\n\nPrompt: “Summarize the key points of the Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting minutes.”\nApplication: Automatically generate concise summaries of long economic documents to save time for economists, policy makers, and analysts.\nNLP Task: Text Summarization.\nExample Tool: transformers with a summarization model like BART or T5.\n\n\n\n5. Economic Sentiment Index from News\n\nPrompt: “Create an Economic Sentiment Index by analyzing the tone of financial news articles published in the last 6 months.”\nApplication: Develop a sentiment index based on the overall tone of economic and financial news to predict market trends or economic cycles.\nNLP Task: Sentiment Analysis combined with aggregation.\nExample Tool: VADER for financial sentiment analysis.\n\n\n\n6. Speech Analysis of Central Bank Governors\n\nPrompt: “Analyze the speeches of central bank governors to identify any shifts in policy direction over the past year.”\nApplication: By analyzing the speeches, we can track any linguistic patterns or changes in word choice that indicate a shift towards more aggressive or accommodative monetary policy.\nNLP Task: Speech-to-text followed by text analysis.\nExample Tool: transformers, spaCy, or Google Speech-to-Text.\n\n\n\n7. Macro Event Detection from News Streams\n\nPrompt: “Detect macroeconomic events such as policy changes, crises, or market shocks from a continuous stream of financial news.”\nApplication: Automatically detect and classify major macroeconomic events in real-time from news data, which can be fed into models for trading or economic forecasting.\nNLP Task: Event Detection.\nExample Tool: spaCy, nltk for event detection.\n\n\n\n8. Central Bank Communication Analysis\n\nPrompt: “Track how often inflation and employment-related terms appear in the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting minutes and identify trends over time.”\nApplication: Identify patterns in the frequency of specific economic terms (like “inflation”, “unemployment”, “interest rates”) to understand central bank focus areas.\nNLP Task: Frequency Analysis, Text Mining.\nExample Tool: nltk or spaCy for word frequency analysis.\n\n\n\n9. Sentiment-driven Stock Market Analysis\n\nPrompt: “Examine the relationship between sentiment in economic news and stock market performance for major indices.”\nApplication: Use NLP-driven sentiment analysis to correlate the mood of economic news with stock market fluctuations, helping to predict short-term market trends.\nNLP Task: Sentiment Analysis, Correlation Analysis.\nExample Tool: transformers, pandas for data handling.\n\n\n\n10. Correlation of Macro Terms with Economic Indicators\n\nPrompt: “Identify the correlation between the occurrence of key macroeconomic terms (e.g., ‘inflation’, ‘recession’) in news and actual economic indicators.”\nApplication: Track how frequently certain terms are mentioned in the media and correlate them with actual macroeconomic data (e.g., inflation rates or GDP growth) to identify lagging or leading indicators.\nNLP Task: Text mining, Correlation Analysis.\nExample Tool: pandas, scikit-learn.\n\n\n\n11. Extracting Forecast Data from Text\n\nPrompt: “Extract GDP, inflation, and unemployment rate forecasts from economic outlook reports issued by financial institutions.”\nApplication: Automatically pull key forecast figures from lengthy reports to aggregate predictions and compare them across institutions.\nNLP Task: Information Extraction.\nExample Tool: spaCy, nltk.\n\n\n\n12. Scenario Analysis from Policy Documents\n\nPrompt: “Identify different economic scenarios (best case, worst case) discussed in fiscal policy reports and compare them.”\nApplication: Extract scenario-based economic forecasts or projections from policy reports to help in decision-making or policy formation.\nNLP Task: Text Classification, Information Extraction.\nExample Tool: transformers for text classification.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nNLP has immense potential in macroeconomics, especially when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data such as financial reports, news articles, and policy documents. By using various NLP techniques, you can extract actionable insights, detect patterns, and even forecast economic variables more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "section": "What will Iqbal say to youth about use of Social Media",
    "text": "What will Iqbal say to youth about use of Social Media\n\nAllama Iqbal, known for his deep reflections on spirituality, selfhood (Khudi), and societal progress, would likely have a nuanced view of social media’s impact on youth. Here’s what he might say:\n1. Distraction from Purpose: Iqbal would likely be concerned about social media’s ability to distract youth from their true purpose. He often emphasized the need for deep self-reflection and personal growth, and he might view the constant scrolling and superficial interactions on social media as hindrances to achieving Khudi. He might say, “The pursuit of likes and followers should not replace the pursuit of self-realization and greater goals.”\n2. Lost Sense of Identity: Iqbal believed in the importance of individual and cultural identity. He might see social media as contributing to a loss of self, where youth are too often influenced by external validation and trends rather than their inner values and cultural heritage. He could warn that “In a world of filters and illusions, do not lose your true self. Your identity is not what others see online, but what you discover within.”\n3. Potential for Positive Change: Despite his concerns, Iqbal would recognize the potential of social media as a powerful tool for positive change. He might encourage the youth to use these platforms to raise awareness about important issues, foster meaningful connections, and promote justice and knowledge. He could say, “Use your voice on these platforms as a means to awaken and uplift, not just to entertain.”\n4. Spiritual and Intellectual Balance: Iqbal would likely urge the youth to balance their time on social media with activities that promote intellectual growth and spiritual reflection. He might remind them that while social media can be a tool for learning and connection, it should not replace the deeper, more personal journey of seeking knowledge and spiritual fulfillment. He might caution, “Do not let fleeting moments of entertainment steal the time meant for the pursuit of wisdom and self-enlightenment.”\n5. The Power of Influence: Iqbal would be keenly aware of social media’s power to influence minds. He would advise youth to be discerning in their consumption of content, warning them not to fall prey to misinformation or hollow trends. He might say, “Just as a gardener tends to what he plants, so too must you guard your mind from the weeds of falsehood and idle talk.”\nIn summary, Iqbal would likely see both the dangers and the opportunities in social media. He would call on the youth to use these platforms wisely, ensuring they foster self-growth, preserve cultural identity, and contribute meaningfully to society, rather than getting lost in the distractions of the digital world.",

    "text": "What will Iqbal say to youth about use of Social Media\n\nAllama Iqbal, known for his deep reflections on spirituality, selfhood (Khudi), and societal progress, would likely have a nuanced view of social media’s impact on youth. Here’s what he might say:\n1. Distraction from Purpose: Iqbal would likely be concerned about social media’s ability to distract youth from their true purpose. He often emphasized the need for deep self-reflection and personal growth, and he might view the constant scrolling and superficial interactions on social media as hindrances to achieving Khudi. He might say, “The pursuit of likes and followers should not replace the pursuit of self-realization and greater goals.”\n2. Lost Sense of Identity: Iqbal believed in the importance of individual and cultural identity. He might see social media as contributing to a loss of self, where youth are too often influenced by external validation and trends rather than their inner values and cultural heritage. He could warn that “In a world of filters and illusions, do not lose your true self. Your identity is not what others see online, but what you discover within.”\n3. Potential for Positive Change: Despite his concerns, Iqbal would recognize the potential of social media as a powerful tool for positive change. He might encourage the youth to use these platforms to raise awareness about important issues, foster meaningful connections, and promote justice and knowledge. He could say, “Use your voice on these platforms as a means to awaken and uplift, not just to entertain.”\n4. Spiritual and Intellectual Balance: Iqbal would likely urge the youth to balance their time on social media with activities that promote intellectual growth and spiritual reflection. He might remind them that while social media can be a tool for learning and connection, it should not replace the deeper, more personal journey of seeking knowledge and spiritual fulfillment. He might caution, “Do not let fleeting moments of entertainment steal the time meant for the pursuit of wisdom and self-enlightenment.”\n5. The Power of Influence: Iqbal would be keenly aware of social media’s power to influence minds. He would advise youth to be discerning in their consumption of content, warning them not to fall prey to misinformation or hollow trends. He might say, “Just as a gardener tends to what he plants, so too must you guard your mind from the weeds of falsehood and idle talk.”\nIn summary, Iqbal would likely see both the dangers and the opportunities in social media. He would call on the youth to use these platforms wisely, ensuring they foster self-growth, preserve cultural identity, and contribute meaningfully to society, rather than getting lost in the distractions of the digital world."

    "text": "What will Iqbal say to youth about use of Social Media\n\nAllama Iqbal, known for his deep reflections on spirituality, selfhood (Khudi), and societal progress, would likely have a nuanced view of social media’s impact on youth. Here’s what he might say:\n1. Distraction from Purpose: Iqbal would likely be concerned about social media’s ability to distract youth from their true purpose. He often emphasized the need for deep self-reflection and personal growth, and he might view the constant scrolling and superficial interactions on social media as hindrances to achieving Khudi. He might say, “The pursuit of likes and followers should not replace the pursuit of self-realization and greater goals.”\n2. Lost Sense of Identity: Iqbal believed in the importance of individual and cultural identity. He might see social media as contributing to a loss of self, where youth are too often influenced by external validation and trends rather than their inner values and cultural heritage. He could warn that “In a world of filters and illusions, do not lose your true self. Your identity is not what others see online, but what you discover within.”\n3. Potential for Positive Change: Despite his concerns, Iqbal would recognize the potential of social media as a powerful tool for positive change. He might encourage the youth to use these platforms to raise awareness about important issues, foster meaningful connections, and promote justice and knowledge. He could say, “Use your voice on these platforms as a means to awaken and uplift, not just to entertain.”\n4. Spiritual and Intellectual Balance: Iqbal would likely urge the youth to balance their time on social media with activities that promote intellectual growth and spiritual reflection. He might remind them that while social media can be a tool for learning and connection, it should not replace the deeper, more personal journey of seeking knowledge and spiritual fulfillment. He might caution, “Do not let fleeting moments of entertainment steal the time meant for the pursuit of wisdom and self-enlightenment.”\n5. The Power of Influence: Iqbal would be keenly aware of social media’s power to influence minds. He would advise youth to be discerning in their consumption of content, warning them not to fall prey to misinformation or hollow trends. He might say, “Just as a gardener tends to what he plants, so too must you guard your mind from the weeds of falsehood and idle talk.”\nIn summary, Iqbal would likely see both the dangers and the opportunities in social media. He would call on the youth to use these platforms wisely, ensuring they foster self-growth, preserve cultural identity, and contribute meaningfully to society, rather than getting lost in the distractions of the digital world."
