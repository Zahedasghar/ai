    "text": "What will Iqbal say to youth about use of Social Media\n\nAllama Iqbal, known for his deep reflections on spirituality, selfhood (Khudi), and societal progress, would likely have a nuanced view of social media’s impact on youth. Here’s what he might say:\n1. Distraction from Purpose: Iqbal would likely be concerned about social media’s ability to distract youth from their true purpose. He often emphasized the need for deep self-reflection and personal growth, and he might view the constant scrolling and superficial interactions on social media as hindrances to achieving Khudi. He might say, “The pursuit of likes and followers should not replace the pursuit of self-realization and greater goals.”\n2. Lost Sense of Identity: Iqbal believed in the importance of individual and cultural identity. He might see social media as contributing to a loss of self, where youth are too often influenced by external validation and trends rather than their inner values and cultural heritage. He could warn that “In a world of filters and illusions, do not lose your true self. Your identity is not what others see online, but what you discover within.”\n3. Potential for Positive Change: Despite his concerns, Iqbal would recognize the potential of social media as a powerful tool for positive change. He might encourage the youth to use these platforms to raise awareness about important issues, foster meaningful connections, and promote justice and knowledge. He could say, “Use your voice on these platforms as a means to awaken and uplift, not just to entertain.”\n4. Spiritual and Intellectual Balance: Iqbal would likely urge the youth to balance their time on social media with activities that promote intellectual growth and spiritual reflection. He might remind them that while social media can be a tool for learning and connection, it should not replace the deeper, more personal journey of seeking knowledge and spiritual fulfillment. He might caution, “Do not let fleeting moments of entertainment steal the time meant for the pursuit of wisdom and self-enlightenment.”\n5. The Power of Influence: Iqbal would be keenly aware of social media’s power to influence minds. He would advise youth to be discerning in their consumption of content, warning them not to fall prey to misinformation or hollow trends. He might say, “Just as a gardener tends to what he plants, so too must you guard your mind from the weeds of falsehood and idle talk.”\nIn summary, Iqbal would likely see both the dangers and the opportunities in social media. He would call on the youth to use these platforms wisely, ensuring they foster self-growth, preserve cultural identity, and contribute meaningfully to society, rather than getting lost in the distractions of the digital world."

    "text": "What will Iqbal say to youth about use of Social Media\n\nAllama Iqbal, known for his deep reflections on spirituality, selfhood (Khudi), and societal progress, would likely have a nuanced view of social media’s impact on youth. Here’s what he might say:\n1. Distraction from Purpose: Iqbal would likely be concerned about social media’s ability to distract youth from their true purpose. He often emphasized the need for deep self-reflection and personal growth, and he might view the constant scrolling and superficial interactions on social media as hindrances to achieving Khudi. He might say, “The pursuit of likes and followers should not replace the pursuit of self-realization and greater goals.”\n2. Lost Sense of Identity: Iqbal believed in the importance of individual and cultural identity. He might see social media as contributing to a loss of self, where youth are too often influenced by external validation and trends rather than their inner values and cultural heritage. He could warn that “In a world of filters and illusions, do not lose your true self. Your identity is not what others see online, but what you discover within.”\n3. Potential for Positive Change: Despite his concerns, Iqbal would recognize the potential of social media as a powerful tool for positive change. He might encourage the youth to use these platforms to raise awareness about important issues, foster meaningful connections, and promote justice and knowledge. He could say, “Use your voice on these platforms as a means to awaken and uplift, not just to entertain.”\n4. Spiritual and Intellectual Balance: Iqbal would likely urge the youth to balance their time on social media with activities that promote intellectual growth and spiritual reflection. He might remind them that while social media can be a tool for learning and connection, it should not replace the deeper, more personal journey of seeking knowledge and spiritual fulfillment. He might caution, “Do not let fleeting moments of entertainment steal the time meant for the pursuit of wisdom and self-enlightenment.”\n5. The Power of Influence: Iqbal would be keenly aware of social media’s power to influence minds. He would advise youth to be discerning in their consumption of content, warning them not to fall prey to misinformation or hollow trends. He might say, “Just as a gardener tends to what he plants, so too must you guard your mind from the weeds of falsehood and idle talk.”\nIn summary, Iqbal would likely see both the dangers and the opportunities in social media. He would call on the youth to use these platforms wisely, ensuring they foster self-growth, preserve cultural identity, and contribute meaningfully to society, rather than getting lost in the distractions of the digital world."

    "text": "LLMs in Economics\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) that automate a plethora of cognitive tasks presents a significant paradigm shift that academic economists should be cognizant of, given the cognitive nature of our work, which includes tasks such as data analysis, economic forecasting, and policy recommendation. The rapid advancements in language models could potentially disrupt our profession, necessitating a proactive approach to this emerging technology.\nIn the short term, these models can augment our productivity by automating routine tasks, thereby allowing us to focus on more complex and nuanced aspects of economic research. However, in the long run, there is a substantial likelihood that these models could displace human economists, as they become increasingly adept at performing complex cognitive tasks. Consequently, it is incumbent upon us to prepare for this eventuality. This could involve developing a deeper understanding of these models to leverage their capabilities effectively, diversifying our skill sets to include areas not easily automated, and advocating for policies that ensure a just transition for those potentially displaced by these technological advancements."

The rapid advancements in language models could potentially disrupt our profession, necessitating a proactive approach to this emerging technology.\nIn the short term, these models can augment our productivity by automating routine tasks, thereby allowing us to focus on more complex and nuanced aspects of economic research. However, in the long run, there is a substantial likelihood that these models could displace human economists, as they become increasingly adept at performing complex cognitive tasks. Consequently, it is incumbent upon us to prepare for this eventuality. This could involve developing a deeper understanding of these models to leverage their capabilities effectively, diversifying our skill sets to include areas not easily automated, and advocating for policies that ensure a just transition for those potentially displaced by these technological advancements."
