## What is Human Intelligence?

**Not a single ability, but a combination:**

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Reasoning
- Problem solving
- Memory
- Language
- Perception
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Creativity
- Pattern recognition
- Emotional depth
- Adaptability
- Connecting dots across disciplines
:::
::::

**Key Difference:** Human intelligence integrates cognitive skills with emotional understanding and contextual awareness.

---

## Can Machines Be Creative?

**Human Creativity:**
- Novel and valuable ideas
- Relies on intuition
- Emotional depth
- Learned experiences
- Contextual understanding

**AI Creativity:**
- Computational power
- Pattern recognition
- Reinforcement learning
- **But lacks:** emotional depth, contextual understanding, interdisciplinary thinking

---

## The AlphaFold Paradox

> *"AI didn't feel its way to solve the puzzle. It exhibited functional creativity but lacks the emotional depths and contextual understanding."*

**World Economic Forum 2025 Top Skills:**
1. Creativity
2. Analytical thinking
3. Critical thinking

**The Problem:** AI tools designed to enhance these skills may actually diminish them.

## Historical Precedent: London Taxi Drivers

**The Knowledge Test:**
- Memorize thousands of streets and landmarks
- Increased hippocampus activity
- Enhanced spatial memory

**GPS Impact:**
- Advantage started to diminish
- Classic example of **cognitive offloading**

---

## Cognitive Offloading Paradox

**Short-term:** More efficient, increased productivity

**Long-term:** Weakened cognitive abilities

**The Brain Mechanism:**
- Creates neural pathways through repeated behaviors
- Problem-solving strengthens neural circuits
- Without engagement: neural density in prefrontal cortex decreases
- Affects analytical reasoning capabilities

---

## The Hiring Question

> *"Do you want to hire a lawyer whose brain is not even capable anymore for analytical reasoning?"*

**The Risk:** AI automation may alter brain structure by reducing cognitive engagement.
