## 2. Video Insight

### Is Automating AI Research Enough for a Growth Explosion?

- **Authors/Presenters**: B. Halperin, T. Houlden + collaborators  
- **Date**: April 2025

**Main Points**  
- Automation in AI research accelerates model development.  
- Growth implications depend on adoption, regulation, and spillovers.  
- Potential bottlenecks: compute capacity, data availability, skills gaps.

**Discussion Prompts**  
- Can full automation replace human researchers?  
- What are the socio-economic risks of hyper-automation?

## 3. Paper Insights

### Steering Technological Progress

- **Authors**: Anton Korinek & Joseph Stiglitz  
- **WP No. 232** | **May 5, 2025** | Institute for New Economic Thinking

**Main Points**  
1. **Market failures in R&D**: underinvestment in socially valuable directions.  
2. **Policy tools**: targeted subsidies, prize mechanisms, regulation of directionality.  
3. **AI-specific challenges**: alignment, concentration of power, externalities.

**Key Prompts**  
- How can governments steer AI toward public-good applications?  
- Which incentives best correct directional under-investment?

## 4. Presentation Take-Aways

### Preparing for the AI Revolution: Strategies for European Countries

- **Organisations**: Complexity Science Hub, CEPR, Oesterreichische Nationalbank

**Strategies Highlighted**  
- **Workforce readiness**: upskilling, life-long learning programs.  
- **Infrastructure**: compute hubs, data commons, cross-border interoperability.  
- **Governance**: regulatory sandboxes, safety standards, EU coordination.  
- **R&D investment**: public-private partnerships, open science initiatives.

**Discussion Questions**  
- Which strategy should EU countries prioritize?  
- How to balance innovation with ethical safeguards?

## 5. Synthesis & Discussion

- **Overarching Themes**  
  - Speed vs. direction: automation boosts pace, but policy must guide outcomes.  
  - Skills and infrastructure are as crucial as algorithms.  
  - International coordination needed to manage global externalities.

- **Open Questions**  
  - What are the main barriers to steering AI research toward societal goals?  
  - How can we measure the “right” direction of technological progress?
